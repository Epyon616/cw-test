# CW Test

Use Node version 13.7.0

## To run the application:

1. CD into the project root
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm start` 

## To run the test suite:

From the root of the application run `npm test`

My testing would have been more extensive with more time, however I understand that this is only meant to be a short test.

All feedback welcome
